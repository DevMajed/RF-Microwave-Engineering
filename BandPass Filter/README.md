# Band Pass Filter Design

# Fast intro

We can make many types of filters using  parallel coupled transmission lines and it is easy in microstrip for bandwidth less than 20% 

. \
Fabrication of multisection bandpass or bandstop coupled line filters is particularly easy in microstrip or stripline form for bandwidths less than about 20%, however for wider bandwidth filters we need tightly coupled lines, and that is hard to fabricate. \
A two-port network can be formed from a coupled line section by terminating two of the four ports with either open or short circuits, or by connecting two ends. \
there are 3 possible band-pass combinations:
