# Directional Coupler

# Fast Intro
The directional coupler is a 4-port network that is designed to divide and distribute RF.Microwave power.\   
Although this would seem to be a particularly mundane and simple task, these devices are both  \
very important in microwave systems, and very difficult to design and construct.  
Two of the reasons for this difficulty are our desire for the device to be: \
1.  Matched 
2.  Lossless  \
Without going into to much math, here are the solutions for the drectional four ports coupler \

The symmetric solutions is:

The asymmetrical solutions is:

Here we can say that port 1 is the input port, port 2 is the through port, port 3 is the coupled port, and port 4 is the isolation port
