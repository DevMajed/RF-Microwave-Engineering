# Directional Coupler

# Fast Intro
The directional coupler is a 4-port network that is designed to divide and distribute RF.Microwave power.\   
Although this would seem to be a particularly mundane and simple task, these devices are both  \
very important in microwave systems, and very difficult to design and construct.  
Two of the reasons for this difficulty are our desire for the device to be: \
1.  Matched 
2.  Lossless
