--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

One or more pins are not fully connected to a
conductive piece of mask layout.
Only FEM simulations are able to process such
pins.
Further details have been written to the layout
processing report.

Generating mesh at 10 GHz...

--- ERROR ---------------------------------------------------------------------

At least one port pin or bondwire end is not
fully connected to a conductive part of the
design (see the layout processing report for
details).
This setup is invalid for a Momentum simulation.
